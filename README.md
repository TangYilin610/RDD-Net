# RDD-Net: Randomized Joint Data-Feature Augmentation and Deep-Shallow Feature Fusion Networks for Automated Diagnosis of Glaucoma

This is the official pytorch implementation of our MICCAI 2024 paper "RDD-Net: Randomized Joint Data-Feature Augmentation and Deep-Shallow Feature Fusion Networks for Automated Diagnosis of Glaucoma". In this paper, we propose a Randomized joint Data-feature augmentation and Deep-shallow feature fusion method for automated diagnosis of glaucoma (RDD-Net). It consists of three main components: Data/Feature-level Augmentation (DFA), Explicit/Implicit augmentation (EI), and Deep-Shallow feature fusion (DS).
